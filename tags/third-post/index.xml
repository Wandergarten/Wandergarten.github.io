      <description>Patient&#39;s data safety and security rights are the highest priority for us. We have built an extensive pre-processing procedure, by which we try to automatically (pseudo)anonymize the data you as the patient&#39;s MD are handing over to us. Note, that we do NOT want to own private data! We encourage you to de-individualize, thus anonymize, your patient&#39;s data yourself before transmitting them to us.
